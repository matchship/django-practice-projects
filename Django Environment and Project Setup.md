# 6. Initializing the project with migrations

After creating the project, the first migrations need to be performed in order to launch the server.
**Use these commands in succession:**

_python manage.py migrate_

After the migrations are done, you will see a 'db.sqlite3' file in project's root directory. This means the server is ready for launch.
